# Green_Stock-Data-Analysis


# Overview




Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.
In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.
Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

This is the first I maybe to analysis the stock data. It reads over and picks the best stocks to invest in at a normal pace for 2018. Time: 0.9902344 sec

This is a similar code that analysis the data but it does it faster for 2018. Time: 0.2792969 sec

This code search the data at a faster rate to find the best stock to invest in for 2017. Time: 0.9902344











# Summary

The advantages of using this code is it helps sorts out what stocks that are good to invest in and what are not. It reads the data that is given. It sorts out the stocks by putting in the requirements that needs to be met for the 2017 and 2018 stocks. Some of the disadvantages of this code is that you would need to change the requirements inside the code to get what you are looking for in the stocking.
